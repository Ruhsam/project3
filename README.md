**** User Story ****

https://trello.com/c/B9zXRsdL

User comes to page and selects sign up. Alternatively there is an option to sign in, which (if selected) will route the user to their profile page. User is brought to a signup page with a form that contains first name, last name, email address, phone number, and password. User enters information (or selects cancel which routes the user to the homepage), selects submit and is rerouted to user profile page. On user profile page, user information is displayed on left (with edit button which pops up modal), bottom shows appointment history, and right shows an image (when selected) routes to the new appointment page. User selects a date and time (1 hour slots) from 9am to 5pm of open appointment times. User also has option to cancel which will route user to profile page. If user books appointment time, an email is sent to user confirming appointment time on appointment booking and 24 hours prior to appointment.
